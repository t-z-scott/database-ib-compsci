# database-ib-compsci

03/30/21 - This is a database project I created for my International Baccalaureate Independent Assessment in high school. We were suppsoed to do it over the span of two years; I was one of the many who started and finished it about a month before it was due. I have fond memories of making this, even though there are certain things that I would change now (with advanced knowledge of Java and coding in general), but I'm posting it in its original form. If I change it later I'll update this file.

Side note - added the schema for the database, not sure the zip file works though...I'm new to Github
